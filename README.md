### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate developer based in Berlin (Germany), currently workining at [Babbel](https://github.com/babbel)

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on getting back my websites and finding cool stuff to code in my free time
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning iOS development
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: an issue in [this repo](https://github.com/unsign3d/unsign3d) is a good start, I can give you more personal info after this

P.S. Some of my repos are a bit old, I'm keeping them as memories and to track how am I growing as a developer, so, please keep in mind the dates when checking for the repos
